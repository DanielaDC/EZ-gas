# CR priority and effort estimate


<For each Change Request in the table define its priority (1 lowest, 5 highest) and the estimated effort
to implement it. Effort is in person hours and includes all activities (design coding testing) and related
update of documents. Consider only effort on the back end (changes to all packages EXCLUDING Controller), exclude effort on the front end.>

<Change requests are described here http://softeng.polito.it/courses/04GSP/#Project   
 Refer STRICTLY to the CR ID on the web page >
