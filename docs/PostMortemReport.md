Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
Even if the current situation forced us to work only remotely, our team worked and cooperated very well.  
This project gave us an experience in software development close to a realistic environment.  

# Worst things
Working with Spring environment was difficult, expecially at the beginning, since no one in our group was familiar with it.  
Due to the distance, communication was in some cases delayed, or in general less effective.

# Suggestions 
The project could start some weeks earlier, since in those weeks we were already capable of doing it.  
More efficient communication could've been useful, given the lack of face-to-face interaction.
