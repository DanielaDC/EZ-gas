# Estimation approach

<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

# Estimate by product decomposition



### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |                24             |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                 70           | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1680|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |      168                                |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |5040 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  1,1                        |           


## New estimates

### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |                30             |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                 100           | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 3000|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |      300                               |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |9000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  1,9                        |         

The new estimates are not so far from the original ones: we now estimate more classes (and then more hours) than before, and more classes than the actual EZGas project, since our original requirements had more elements in them.


# Estimate by activity decomposition

| Requirement Inspection | 32|
| Design                 | 64|
| Design Inspection      | 32|
| Coding                 | 160|

We provided higher estimations, expecially for the coding section, because we didn't know well how much time it would've taken, and to be more conservative we provided an higher number.
